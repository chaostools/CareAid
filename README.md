#CareAid

This was a minimal viable product that i and my team mates made during #HackJMI hackathon. This product won a consolation price 

Details:

We proposed an iot based solution for elderly in times of emergency. we   proposed to build an iot watch button with a sim which  send an sms on the press of a button. on recieving such message, this app installed in user's mobile (particularly a caretaker) would immediately ring a loud bell and user will be able to reach to elderly immediately
